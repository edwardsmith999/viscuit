# viscuit

A code which reads in a time trajectory from MD and calculates the viscuit, developed in various papers belowo. The example here reads data in either binary of ascii format which has been generated by a LJ case with T=0.722 and rho=0.8442, cut off of 2.5 in the NVT ensemble. This can be replaced by output from any MD code.
